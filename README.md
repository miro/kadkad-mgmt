Better README is on the works.


## Quick-start development

The JavaScript-thingies on this app is built using *webpack*. Styles are built using *gulp*.

You must have node version of >= 4.x

* `npm install`
* `npm run start:dev` to start webpack dev server at port 9010
* `npm run build-css:dev` to start SCSS to CSS build and BrowserSync at port 3000
* -> now you can open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and you should see the app with React hot-reload enabled and live injecting of CSS via BrowserSync!


## Running in production

To create a production build, run `npm run build`


## Running tests
